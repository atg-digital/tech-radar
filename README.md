# ATG Engineering's Tech Radar

Using ThoughtWorks's Tech Radar tool we present our own [ATG Engineering Technology Radar](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fatg-digital%2Ftech-radar%2Fmaster%2FATG%2520Engineering%2520Tech%2520Radar.csv).

This is a work-in-progress by the engineering team at ATG, once fully approved by the team it will be kept up-to-date as we discuss new technologies within the team.

> **Note to ATG Engineering Team**:
> This is a _public_ repo and represents ATG to the broader engineering community outside of our organisation. As such, please be mindful of the audience of your comments within PRs.
